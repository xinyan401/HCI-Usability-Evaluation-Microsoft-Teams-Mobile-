## 👩‍💻 My Contribution

Based on the group division of work and my actual participation, my contributions were:

### ✔ Section 1.0 – Overview of Usability & Usability Testing
Wrote the introduction explaining usability concepts, usability components, and the purpose of usability testing in mobile applications.

### ✔ Section 2.0 – Overview of Post-Study Questionnaires
Explained the theory behind QUIS, SUS, CSUQ and other post-study questionnaires, including how they measure user satisfaction.

### ✔ Designed & Managed the Demographic Google Form
Created the Google Form to collect participant demographic data (age, gender, education, smartphone experience, familiarity with Teams).

### ✔ Data Cleaning & Organization (Demographic Responses)
Collected, cleaned, and organized the demographic data exported from Google Forms.
(*Note: SEQ and QUIS score aggregation was handled by another team member.*)

### ✔ Conducted Usability Testing & Assisted in Data Recording
Participated in testing sessions by:
- Observing participants completing tasks
- Recording time-on-task
- Recording task completion / failure
- Noting user errors and assistance needed
- Writing down user comments & behavior during tasks

### ✔ Assisted in Report Compilation & Formatting
Helped structure and format the final PDF to ensure consistency and clarity.

- Observed user frustration/hesitation  

### **3. Subjective Measures**
(Organized by another team member)
- QUIS  
- SEQ  

### **4. Prototype Redesign**
